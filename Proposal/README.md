# AI Tool For Reviewing and Analyzing Exercises

This tool will train on various expert's exercise videos, and learn what proper form should look like depending on the goal of the exercise. 
After training, it will view other videos, and determine what, if anything, was incorrect in the terms of technique, speed, etc.

The training data is expected to be collected through: 
- Requesting reviewing/raw footage from various trained athletes
- Scraping existing exercise video libraries
- Manually obtaining video clips through youtube or other platforms

This tool should, with the training data, be able to determine: 
- optimal range of motion
- optimal depth of each exercise
- visualize vectors of force

NLP may be imlemented in the way of a chatbot, which will provide more in depth analysis or extra information when requested by the user.

More research will be done on individual exercises to determine the points of interests for each exercise.

The domain and range of the project are currently undecided, as I don't know how much information can be accurately obtained, nor have I decided on any algorithms to use.
I will try to find applicable CV papers, and see if this problem has been worked on before, and what tools can be applied to the project.
